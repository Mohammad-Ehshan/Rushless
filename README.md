# 🚗 RushLess – AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
Traffic congestion, inefficient signals, delayed emergency responses, and parking struggles create major urban challenges. **RushLess** leverages **AI, IoT, and real-time data** to optimize traffic flow, prioritize emergency vehicles, detect accidents, and provide smart parking solutions—making cities safer, faster, and more efficient.

## 🚦 The Problem We Solve
✔ **Traffic Jams & Delays** – Inefficient signals and congestion lead to unnecessary wait times and fuel waste.  
✔ **Emergency Blockages** – Ambulances and fire trucks get stuck in traffic, causing life-threatening delays.  
✔ **Accident Chaos** – Slow detection and response escalate traffic disruptions and safety risks.  
✔ **Parking Struggles** – Unorganized roadside parking contributes to **15-20% of congestion** and wasted fuel.  

## 🔥 Our AI-Driven Solution
✅ **AI-Powered Traffic Lights** – Adjusts signals dynamically based on real-time traffic density, reducing wait times by **35-40%**.  
✅ **Emergency Vehicle Priority System** – Clears traffic lanes for ambulances and fire trucks, cutting emergency delays by **50%**.  
✅ **Accident Detection & Instant Alerts** – Uses machine learning to detect accidents and notify authorities within seconds.  
✅ **Smart Parking Management** – Finds and reserves parking spots in real time, reducing congestion by **15-20%**.  

## ⚡ Key Technologies
