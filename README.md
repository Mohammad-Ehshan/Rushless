-Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: IoT-enabled sensors and surveillance cameras collect live traffic and parking data.  

-Traffic Prediction: CNNs and LSTMs analyze traffic patterns and predict congestion.

-Smart Parking System: YOLOv5-based computer vision detects available parking slots in real-time.

-AI-Powered Traffic Lights: A reinforcement learning-based Traffic Light Controller (TLC) using DQN dynamically adjusts signal timings to optimize traffic flow.

(DISCLAIMER: Some codes are not push till now due to working on different system and will be pushed in some time)
